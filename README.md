# 🗺️ OSM Path Tracker

A simple Flutter package for **live GPS tracking**, **path drawing**, and **navigation** on **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** using `flutter_map`.  
`osm_path_tracker` helps you track a path in real-time, visualize it, and output a reusable model (`PathModel`) so you can store the tracked path **wherever you want** — Firebase, SQLite, REST APIs, or files.
